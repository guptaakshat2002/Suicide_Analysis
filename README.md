# Suicide Analysis Project

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of suicide data across different states and years in India. Using Python and libraries like Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Pandas, the notebook explores trends, compares regional statistics, and visualizes suicide patterns to generate valuable insights.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Visualize the total number of suicides per year.
- Identify states with the highest and lowest suicide rates.
- Analyze gender-based and age-group-based suicide trends.
- Make insights more accessible using professional-quality data visualizations.

---

## ðŸ“Š Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and aggregation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For rich and clean visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive data exploration and reporting.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Visualizations

- **Total Suicides Per Year**: Bar plot showing annual suicide counts.
- **State-wise Suicides**: Sorted bar charts showing states with the most and least suicides.
- **Gender and Age Analysis**: Insights into suicide distribution by gender and age groups.
- **Professional Enhancements**:
  - Custom color palettes (`tab20`, `crest`)
  - Lakhs formatter for y-axis (`1.0 L` = 1 lakh)
  - Data labels on bars
  - Rotated x-axis labels for readability
  - Clean layout with `tight_layout()` and `whitegrid` theme

## ðŸ“Œ How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open `SUICIDE_Analysis.ipynb` in **Jupyter Notebook** or **VS Code**.
3. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
           pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
4. Run the cells to explore the data and generate the plots.
